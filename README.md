- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Sam Waggoner. I'm currently a software dev intern at CourseStorm, and also have IT project management experience as an intern at MEMIC. I have experience with Python, Java, PHP, and C#. I am novice with HTML, CSS, and JS. I hope to learn these languages better and to make a project of creating a website. Iâ€™m also looking forward to taking a class about AI next semester at UMaine.
