- 👋 Hello, I’m Sam Waggoner
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new languages and expanding what I can do with code.
- 🌱 I have experience with Python, Java, object-oriented programming, and will be learning more about C#.
- 💞️ I use this site as a place to store some of my work and and also as a platform on which I can learn from others' code.
