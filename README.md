- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Sam Waggoner. I will be an IT intern at Texas Instruments this summer. I have been a software dev intern at CourseStorm, and also have IT project management experience as an intern at MEMIC. I have experience with Python, Java, PHP, and C#. I am novice with HTML, CSS, and JS. Iâ€™m enjoying an AI class at UMaine right now, and look forward to taking Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
