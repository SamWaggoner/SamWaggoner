- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Sam Waggoner. I am a software developer in rotation at Texas Instruments. I have been a software dev intern at TI and CourseStorm, and also have IT project management experience as an intern at MEMIC. I have experience with Python, Java, PHP, and C#. I am novice with HTML, CSS, and JS. Iâ€™m enjoying ML classes at UMaine right now, and look forward to taking more classes including Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
