- 👋 Hello, I’m Sam Waggoner
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new languages and expanding what I can do with code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript and object-oriented programming.
- 💞️ I use this site as a place to store some of my work and as a place where I can see what other people are coding.
